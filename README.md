# TinyLLM

> **Building GPT from the Ground Up** – A miniature transformer-based language model crafted entirely from scratch

## About

TinyLLM is a from-scratch implementation of a transformer-based language model, inspired by GPT architecture but designed to be lightweight and educational. This project demonstrates the core principles of modern large language models without the complexity of production-scale systems.

## Key Features

- **Pure Transformer Architecture** – Built on the same attention mechanisms that power GPT
- **From Scratch Implementation** – Every component handcrafted to understand the fundamentals
- **Lightweight & Efficient** – Smaller scale perfect for learning and experimentation
- **Educational Focus** – Clear, readable code for understanding how LLMs work under the hood

## Architecture

TinyLLM implements the essential building blocks of transformer models:
- Multi-head self-attention mechanisms
- Positional encodings
- Feed-forward neural networks
- Layer normalization
- Token embeddings

## Project Goals

- Understand transformer architecture from first principles
- Implement core components of GPT-style models
- Create a functional, trainable language model
- Maintain simplicity for educational purposes

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core implementation language
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow** – Deep learning framework
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
